    "Technical Elective Courses:",
    "Students select a minimum of 12 units of technical electives. For students majoring in both Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, a core course in one major cannot be counted as a technical elective in the other major. Any upper-division course in the department not used for the degree may be used as a technical elective. At least 4 units of technical electives must come from ENGRMAE upper-division courses and no more than 4 units of the technical electives should come from ENGRMAE\u00a0188, ENGRMAE\u00a0189, and ENGRMAE\u00a0199. With approval of the Undergraduate Advisor, students may choose from other departments\u2019 upper-division courses that have primarily technical content. Preapproved courses are listed on the MAE website: http://engineering.uci.edu/files/mae-technical-electives.pdf",
